# My First Git Test Project
Hellooo. I really liked this system. Oh, how late I am. It used to scare me so much. Now, I'm slowly realizing how wonderful it is. Wait for me. Wait for me, the real world of software. I've let go of my fears and I'm coming.
## I'm still learning
In fact, I've realized that I'm just beginning to learn
## I wanted to try applying what I've learned in the course without forgetting it.
I was also thinking that something was missing. Now, I've found what was missing. Maybe I always knew. But it scared me. Now, I have the courage to face it.
## That's enough for now. I'm going back to watching courses and learning.

<br/>

## I will come again!
